# Cave

ReTry on gravity force - like game with goal to restore crashed ship parts from thecaves with tractorbeam or rope like mechanics.
Initial development will be done on linux and libsdl2 abd libbox2d to keep things simple.

ideas so far:
  - Generated caves (maybe cellular automata + voronoi)
  - Simple physics engine with rope/tractorbeam features
  - Store to sell parts and buy upgrades for ship
  - PS4 / xbox joystick support (dualstick controls -> direction and thusters, rope/tractorbeam control)
  - Multiple caves/planets to scavenge from
